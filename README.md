# Chronoline

A multiplayer game of chronological events. Inspired by the board game [Timeline](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128664/timeline).

## Getting Started

The game is separated into a backend and frontend. There's two different set of commands for them. Furthermore, the card generation is now a standalone app and is contained within the
_generator_ folder.

The backend uses the **cards.json** file generated by the generator and is automatically provided and updated in this repo. If you want to use the generator manually,
the commands are also available below.

### Dependencies
